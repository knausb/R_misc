## Aquiring a repository


When I see a repository on GitHub that I'm interested in I'll do one of two things.
Typically I'll just clone it and use their code.
If I think I'd like to contribute, I'll fork it and then clone my fork.
I think the important difference is that I can make changes to my fork but can't if I just clone someone else's repository.
More information can be found at [The difference between forking and cloning a repository](https://github.community/t/the-difference-between-forking-and-cloning-a-repository/10189).


Once I've decided I'd like to clone a GitHub repository I look for a button that allows me to copy the ssh information.
These days there is a 'Code' button with a dropdown menu.


```{r, out.width="80%", fig.cap="**Figure X.** Example of clone information.", prompt=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
options(prompt = 'R> ')
knitr::include_graphics("github_clone.png")
```


Once copied to the clipboard I can use the following to clone the repository to a local volume.


```
bash$ git clone git@github.com:knausb/R_misc.git
```


This will create a directory called ```R_misc``` which contains the repo.


```
bash$ git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```


Here it tells me that I'm on the branch named 'main' (note that older repositories may use 'master' as the default branch).
It also tells me if I've modified any files that I need to commit.
It also gives me hints on commands that it thinks might help me.


## Forking a repository


If you clone a repository you can make changes to your local clone, but you can't push back to the repository if it is not yours.
In order to fork the GitHub repository to your account you can click on the fork button for the repository and then clone your repository to crearte a local copy.


```{r, out.width="80%", fig.cap="**Figure X.** Example of fork information.", prompt=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("github_fork.png")
```


## Editing files


Text files can be created and deleted with your favorite text editor.
Once editing is complete you can check the repository again with `git status`.
We'll then want to add them and then commit them with a message describing the changes.


```
bash$ git add how_i_git.*
bash$ git commit -m "made important changes to how_i_git"
bash$ git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```


## Remotes


When working with remotes, such as GitHub, you'll want to update your changes there as well.
This will allow you to share your code with others, and allow others to contribute to your code.
We'll accomplish this by pushing our changes to the remote.
But first we need to pull from the remote.
This will update our copy with any changes that have been made to the remote since we last updated our version.
This is important here because sometimes this requires a manual curation step by a human.
We can then push our changes to incorporate them into the remote.


```
bash$ git pull origin main
bash$ git push origin main
```

More information on working with remotes can be found at the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches).


## Branches


Branches are an important concept in git, but they also add complexity.
Branches are how git manages different versions of the project.
For example, if you would like to propose changes to a project you can create a branch to work on.
Changes to this branch will not affect the main branch, so you do not need to worry about breaking things.
If you manage to avoid breaking things, and instead fix things, you can merge that branch into your main branch, or some other branch.


We can query what branches exist as follows.


```
bash$ git branch -a
```

```
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
```


If we would like to create a new branch, so that we can attempt to address a new issue, we can create a new branch and switch to it as follows.


```
bash$ git checkout -b brnc2
```

```
Switched to a new branch "brnc2"
```


If the branch we wish to switch to already exists, we can change to it as follows.


```
bash$ git checkout brnc2
```


Once we have checked out this branch we can edit files like any other files we would edit.
We can also ```add``` and ```commit``` to this branch as we did above.
We can also `push` and `pull` to a remote, as above, but we need to accommodate the different branch.


```
bash$ git pull origin brnc2
bash$ git push origin brnc2
```


When you feel you have arrived at a solution you can merge it back to the main branch as follows.


```
bash$ git checkout main
bash$ merge brnc2
```


If you know what is on the respective branches, this is fine.
If it's been a while and you do not remember the details of a branch, or someone else provides a branch, you'll want to compare the branches.
Finding differences among text files is typically done with `diff`, how to accomplish this in the context of git is explained at [this SO link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20808892/git-diff-between-current-branch-and-master-but-not-including-unmerged-master-com).
Many of us use a graphical diff client, such as [meld](https://meldmerge.org/).
An explanation on how to use meld with git can be found at [this SO link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2006032/view-differences-of-branches-with-meld).


## Pull requests


A GitHub pull request allows you to propose changes on a branch that you've worked on and it allows you to include messages to describe and discuss the proposal.
It also allows you to propose changes to a repository where you have no permissions (i.e., someone else's repository).
Pull requests are implemented through GitHub's web based interface, which should provide guidance as you make decisions.
More information on GitHub pull requests can be found at their documentation: [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

The default is for GitHub to merge pull requests into the default branch (main, master).
We can optionally merge into any other branch (e.g., `devel`) as well.
Information on how to merge a pull request to a different branch than default can be found at [this SO link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38985999).
